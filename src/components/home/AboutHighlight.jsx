        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Founded in 2016, UKUiki is a creative hub where art meets music. We
          started by handpainting ukuleles and quickly grew into a vibrant
          community through workshops and ukulele classes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          To stay connected with alumni, we formed the UKUiki Club â€” a space for
          jamming, learning, and building friendships. Later, the UKUiki
          Ensemble was born to embrace our shared passion for music.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Each of our ukuleles is handpainted, customizable, and one-of-a-kind.
          From whimsical foxes to festive themes, our designs are all crafted by{" "}
