            UKUiki was founded in early 2016 to express our love for art and
            music by painting ukuleles. What began as a personal passion grew
            into something more meaningful.

                Our Story
              </h2>
              <p>
                Encouraged by positive feedback from friends, family, and
                customers, we began organizing workshops and ukulele classes to
                spread the joy of music and help others learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                To keep in touch with alumni of our classes, we founded the{" "}
                <strong>UKUiki Club</strong> â€” a friendly community where
                members share ukulele knowledge, jam together, and build
                friendships.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fueled by our shared love of music, the{" "}
                <strong>UKUiki Ensemble</strong> was later formed as a group
                that performs and celebrates ukulele music together.
